    "# Dataframes with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataframes are the common format for social science data, whether you are using SAS, Excel, R, SPSS, Python or any other analytical software. Imagine a dataframes as a table of values where, generally speaking, each column is a variable and each row is a unit of observation. In this chapter, you will become familiar with using dataframes by creating some imaginary data before moving to real datasets from the American Community Survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest bit of data is a single observation, and it is not very useful on its own: _\"Person X's height is 177 centimeters.\"_ Multiple observations like this, however, are more useful. If a medical researcher recorded the height of twenty patients, we would have one variable's worth of data. If this researcher recorded those observations into a spreadsheet, a script of code, or even some paper, as a series of consecutive values, they would have a vector of data. A vector is a one-dimensional series of values; it has one dimension in the sense that there is one data point over $x$ number of observations. So our example vector with twenty people's recorded heights has the shape $1 \\times 20$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that the terms used to describe a vector will change across different programming languages. In Python, a one-dimensional series of data points is called an __array__. Although the concept and shape of the data are essentially the same, there are other forms and names for a one-dimensional vector in Python programming, which have their own distinct uses and quirks. In this book, we will use the terms vector and array interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, you can create an array for the recorded height of twenty patients. Notice that the code assigns a series of values for height in centimeters, each separated by commas, to an object we decided to call `patient_height`. Note also that the values are encased in square brackets `[ ... ]`. Try writing a new line, copying code below, and replace the square brackets with curly brackets `{ ... }` and see how the cell's output changes. This is because Python generates arrays with square brackets `[]`, and unordered __sets__ with curly brackets `{}`."

Using only Python code, you will be able to download the raw data to your computer, load it to the Jupyter Notebook, select relevant variables, subset relevant observations, and make a new variable with basic vector math. ACS data is very wide; each year has multiple datasets for the type of location the census is counting, and each dataset has hundreds of variables to choose from. Additionally, there are datasets for yearly, three-year, and five-year collections. \n",

ACS provides their data tables in [Comma separated values]() format, or CSV. This is essentially a text file where every variable is separated by a comma, and each row/observation is a single line of text. These two features are all Python and pandas need to interpret CSV files into a dataframe. \n",

    "### Selecting Columns\n",
    "Usually, you're going to work with data that is this big or bigger, but only a few variables will actually be relevant to your research. For this chapter we definitely don't need to look at 619 variables. In the case of the 2022 ACS County Data, the first two variables, `GEO_ID` and `NAME` should remain without question: these represent the actual units of observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "ACS provides researchers with a [column metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZacharyST/Python_for_Social_Science/main/Data/ACS/DP02/County/ACSDP1Y2022.DP02-Column-Metadata.csv) file for ever one of their data files. The column metadata file tells us all of the variable _names_ and their _label_ or descriptions. For our exercise, we are going to select the following variables:\n",
    "- DP02_0001E - Total households\n",
    "- DP02_0018E - Population in households\n",
    "- DP02_0053PE - Population 3 years and over enrolled in school\n",

    "We select by assigning the subset of variables that we want to take from the `ACS_2022` dataframe, into a new object named `education_pop`. No actual function is needed here, you just need double-brackets `[[]]`, and to remember to put the variable names in quotes."

What does the first observation on row 0 look like? This is the data labels row and it is keeping Python from interpreting our numeric values as numbers.

    "Success! Python now understands that our numeric variables are indeed float (numeric) data types. Some comments about the code above: We had to specify each variable that needed transforming on the left side of the $=$ sign as the columns to receive new values from the right side of the $=$ sign. Then, we needed to repeat this specification of the columns to transform into numeric data types with `.apply(pd.to_numeric)`. The spacing might look a little odd right now, but you will become used to it! Lines of code can be incredibly long, and pressing the enter key to break the length of the line is a crucial part of making your code legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might be curious about the data types of our first two variables, `GEO_ID` and `COUNTY`, and whether we ought to transform these into _string_ types. The short answer would be no; We should only really worry if a column that we know is numeric is not categorized as such. This is because most, if not all, mathematical functions require numeric columns as inputs. There aren't as many text-based operators that are as strict about an object type for the whole column.\n",

    "One of our dataframe's variables has a name that is inconsistent with the values within the variable however. The column `NAME` actually contains two values in each cell, the county name and the state name, separated by a comma. It would be more helpful for us to have these two variables as separate columns. You can use `str.split()` to make two new columns, then `.insert()` to place them after the original `NAME` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str.split()` function takes the values in a cell and separates them by whatever symbol you tell it is the delimiter. In our case the county and state are separated by a comma. The function spits out two series of values, one on either side of a comma: The first value is indexed as `0`, and the second value is indexed as position `1`, etc., just like the vectors we have been creating in this chapter."

    "### New Variable Creation: Vector Math\n",
    "Similarly to the string split variables we created above, we can use basic math operators in python to calculate new values based on the numbers in our data. Take the final five columns in our data. They represent the percentage of enrolled students at different levels of education, from pre-k to college and graduate school. We might be more interested in the actual number of people enrolled in college, not the percentage. We can create that new column with some simple math and (relatively) simple code! Let's look at the problem a little more abstractly. We have the total number of people enrolled in some form of educational institution in the variable `TOT_ENROLLED`, and percentages of that total number in the final five columns of the dataframe. We can calculate the actual number of people using the percentage as a decimal, that is, if the percentage is $19\\%$, you multiply total population times $0.19$ to get the right number of people. \n",

    "So we have to think of those data points we are operating upon as cells along a vector. Pandas lets you do that quite easily: You provide the names of the columns and the math operators you need, including using parentheses for specific order-of-operations. Let's see one way to do it in the following steps:\n",

Subsets of data are sections of the whole dataset that meet some specific criteria that are of interest to you. We just subset a ACS 2022 dataset into a smaller dataset few relevant variables, for example. However, there are still hundreds and hundreds of observations that may not all be relevant or useful to your interests. A researcher might only need data for a specific state or region. If that was the case, we can subset with conditional statements using `str.contains()`. This would be a filtering process."

This is particularly useful when we are interested in the greatest or least observations for a given variable. For example, what if we were curious about the counties with the highest proportion of residents enrolled in college? We should sort by descending values along the `COLLEGE` column using `.sort_values()`, and see the top ten counties with the `head()` function. We include an argument that `ascending=False` to make the data go from largest to smallest value. The default value is `True`, and sorting this way will give you values smallest to largest, so pay attention!"

    "For our imaginary sample of patient data at the beginning of the chapter, we created all of our vectors using a random number generator from the `numpy` package. The function returns random numbers based on some parameters we provided. We wanted to create height, weight, calorie, and minutes, all of which tend to look like a normal distribution (or a bell curve if you've heard of it called that way). So we use the `np.random.normal()` function and give it \n",
    "- an average value with `loc=`\n",
    "- the standard deviation around the mean with `scale=`\n",
    "- and the number of random numbers to produce with `size=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For height, calories, and minutes of daily activity, we wanted the numbers to be whole, without decimal points, so we added `.astype(int)` to our random number generator line. We did want decimal points for weight on the other hand, so we wrapped the entire random function inside of `np.round(..., decimals=y)` to specify the number of decimal points. Finally, we did a very superficial web search with term like \"daily physical activity mean and standard deviation\" to make somewhat realistic averages and standard deviations.\n",
