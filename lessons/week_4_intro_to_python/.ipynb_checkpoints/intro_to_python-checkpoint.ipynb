    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "You have already done a great deal of management and analysis of social science data with Python in this book. It may seem silly to introduce python in the fourth chapter of this book, but we wanted to motivate readers with hands-on experience programming real data about the real world. However, it is now time to delve into the programming language you have been running since chapter one. This chapter introduces core Python concepts that will accompany you every step of the way as you code more and more scripts and projects. They are concepts that all Python programmers understand innately, whether they're social scientists, data scientists, or software developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts are very concrete, so don't fear that this chapter is especially theoretical. You'll learn about the 'object' in 'object-oriented programming', data _types_, data _structures_, math operations, using and creating functions, and package management.   \n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "Think back to the previous chapters of this book where we talked about 'assigning' something a name using the `=` sign. What you were doing here was creating, sometimes updating, an object in Python. Objects can have take on many different forms and can be described many ways, and that is what the subsequent sections of this chapter are about. But first we want to really drive home that objects are the bread and butter of programming in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've already seen us assign data into dataframe objects like so:"

We could make this more concrete with a human example: like `a = 'a'` in our code, a person in our data is named `Helen`. And like the name Helen, variable `a` is a `str` or string variable. This is as simple as can be, although managing string variables is a\n",
