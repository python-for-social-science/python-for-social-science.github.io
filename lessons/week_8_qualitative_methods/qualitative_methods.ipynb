    "# Qualitative Analysis of Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data types are a major part of the data which social scientists can study, and we will dedicate this chapter to the tools that will help you manage text in Python. Remember that in programming the term 'string' is a synonym for data that comes in the form of text. As opposed to the quantitative analysis chapter, you can also understand strings as any non-numeric data. You might be studying survey data where open-ended questions give nuance and context to closed-ended quantitative questions about survey respondents' opinions on a given topic. Social media data around people's posts are predominantly text: The users' posts and conversations, hastags, place names, even the date is parsed as a string variable. It is up to the researcher, then, to parse this data that is often the least structured and hardest to analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing the lesson we want to make it clear that this chapter is not about qualitative methods in social science. That aspect of social science research encompasses interviews, focus groups, ethnography, photography and videography, audio recordings, and a very rigorous and detailed process of coding and describing the data to  create meaning around your research question. This chapter cannot teach your those methods. This chapter is about string variables, cleaning strings, formatting strings, and searching and matching strings so that you can better understand and use the text data available to you. This chapter can get you to where your qualitative data are ready for analysis, but the analytical methods will be beyond the scope of this book.\n",

    "\n",
    "This chapter revisits the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). You had some experience with the ACLED data in the second pandas chapter, including a basic introduction to pandas' string search function .str.contains(). You will learn more about searching strings and text formatting with this very text-heavy dataset. ACLED data comes with specific regions of the world in different CSV files. We have chosen the South America region for you in the code cell below. We also wanted you to have a more succinct dataframe, so you will be using the `usecols=''` argument again to load specific columns from the CSV file instead of having to load the complete data and then subsetting by variable. Below the columns we chose and their descriptions according to the ACLED [codebook](https://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/codebook/).\n",

    "For date and time formatting that is a step more advanced, you can utilize pandas' own date and time functions to transform our event_date variable from a string type into a datetime type. This is important to learn because date variables are logically numeric. You can subtract one date from another to learn the time passed between dates, as well tell how long ago an event was from the present date. These operations should prove useful and you can make date calculations for spans of time if your date variables are in the right format.\n",

    "The simplest function would be to convert a string or numeric column with something that looks like a date, into a date with `pd.to_datetime()`. Below you will pass the event_date column to the datetime function. Observe how the original column's format changes from our previous format (15/April/2022) to the datetime standard (2022-04-15). We added the .info function at the end of each line to show you how the column goes from an 'object' datatype into a 'datetime64' datatype."

You might notice the notes use other terms such as 'navy', 'army' , 'air force', 'military' (and maybe 'police' if appropriate).
