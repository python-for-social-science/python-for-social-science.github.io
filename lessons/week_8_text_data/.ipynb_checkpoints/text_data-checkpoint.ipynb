    "# Working with text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data types are a major part of the data which social scientists can study, and we will dedicate this chapter to the tools that will help you manage text in Python. Remember that in programming the term 'string' is a synonym for data that comes in the form of text. As opposed to the quantitative analysis chapter, you can also understand strings as any non-numeric data. You might be studying survey data where open-ended questions give nuance and context to closed-ended quantitative questions about survey respondents' opinions on a given topic. Social media data around people's posts are predominantly text: The users' posts and conversations, hastags, place names, even the date is parsed as a string variable. It is up to the researcher, then, to parse this data that is often the least structured and hardest to analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing the lesson we want to make it clear that this chapter is not about qualitative methods in social science. That aspect of social science research encompasses interviews, focus groups, ethnography, photography and videography, audio recordings, and a very rigorous and detailed process of coding and describing the data to  create meaning around your research question. This chapter cannot teach your those methods. This chapter is about string variables, cleaning strings, formatting strings, and searching and matching strings so that you can better understand and use the text data available to you. This chapter can get you to where your qualitative data are ready for analysis, but the analytical methods will be beyond the scope of this book.\n",

    "\n",
    "This chapter revisits the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). You had some experience with the ACLED data in the second pandas chapter, including a basic introduction to pandas' string search function .str.contains(). You will learn more about searching strings and text formatting with this very text-heavy dataset. ACLED data comes with specific regions of the world in different CSV files. We have chosen the South America region for you in the code cell below. We also wanted you to have a more succinct dataframe, so you will be using the `usecols=''` argument again to load specific columns from the CSV file instead of having to load the complete data and then subsetting by variable. Below the columns we chose and their descriptions according to the ACLED [codebook](https://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/codebook/).\n",

    "For date and time formatting that is a step more advanced, you can utilize pandas' own date and time functions to transform our event_date variable from a string type into a datetime type. This is important to learn because date variables are logically numeric. You can subtract one date from another to learn the time passed between dates, as well tell how long ago an event was from the present date. These operations should prove useful and you can make date calculations for spans of time if your date variables are in the right format.\n",

Observe how the original column's format changes from our previous format (15/April/2022) to the datetime standard (2022-04-15). "

So the regex pattern actually has to repeat a matching pattern reversed! Thus the regex pattern would be `(?i)(plane.*(air force|military)` and ` | ` and `(military|air force).*plane)`"

    "### Creating a new event size variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The `notes` variable doesn't just provide commentary, there is data stored in these accounts of conflict events. When a conflict was deadly, the ACLED data provides the number of fatalities as a numeric variable. But there is no variable to describe the size of protests and riots where no fatalities were recorded. There are, however, comments within the notes variable if the number of people is counted or estimated. An example of what this description looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> On 14 April 2022, in Puerto Iguazu (Misiones), around 50 members of the Education Workers Front, Association of State Workers (ATE), and the Argentine Workers' Central Union (CTA) blocked the National Route 101, interfering in the access to the Iguazu Falls and the international airport, as means to demand a decent salary. The protest took place during an extended holiday, complicating the entrance of 8,000 tourists who had tickets to enter the national park. [size=around 50]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use str.extract() to pull the size value from `notes` into a new column called `event_size` and sort and analyze the resulting data. This is relatively easy to do because the text follows a clear pattern: within quare brackets, after the string `size=`. This makes this figure a prime candidate for regular expressions. Using str.extract(), the pattern you should provide does something new compared to the country code examples. We have a regex pattern to match first, the square brackets and 'size=', but we want to _extract_ what's inside the brackets. That pattern to extract must go in parentheses, and the pattern we don't want to extract will be around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern explained in parts: `\\[` is the special open-bracket character, `size=` is the actual string, `(.*?)` is any character any unlimited number of times, `\\]` is the special close-bracket character. We attach a dropna() function to clean up the many missing variables, and then describe it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the types of strings you extracted with regular expressions, assign the values to a new `size` object. It will have as many rows as the south_america data frame, with just one column for the extracted matched strings. To this size object, apply the pandas `.value_counts()` function. This will give you a table with the strings and the number of occurrances. "
