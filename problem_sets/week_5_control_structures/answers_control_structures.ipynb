    "In the next lesson, we would like to visualize data for specific points in time a well as across several years of data. The American Community Survey DP04 housing dataset has data files from 2010 to 2022, which is suitable for visualizing group and time-series variables. \n",

This means loading in multiple ACS datasets with a for-loop. Then the data needs cleaning.
