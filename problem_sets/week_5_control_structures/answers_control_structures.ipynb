    "In the next chapter on data visualization, we would like to visualize data for specific points in time a well as across several years of data. The American Community Survey DP04 housing dataset has data files from 2010 to 2022, which is suitable for visualizing group and time-series variables. Instead of loading twelve individual datasets, you will be merging all the data available like you practiced in the control structures chapter. This means loading in multiple ACS datasets with a for loop. Then the data needs cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem set is a little different in that each question leads towards a final usable dataframe. It is also a change from previous problem sets in that you will have to put several questions/problems together into a single code cell, as opposed to past problem sets where we generally asked for one line of code per question. Be sure to read the questions carefully so that your code meets all of the requirements.\n",

    "For this task you will need to create a for loop to read several ACS files, which you have practice doing. There is also some cleaning and and manipulation, like you have seen in the introduction to pandas chapters one and two. We'll provide step by step instructions for each code cell, and by the end of this assignment, you should have one `housing` dataframe that encompasses every year of housing information for the DP04 1-Year data, from 2010 to 2022"
