    "8. According to the map you made of transit stops, Los Angeles County has significantly more transit stops than the other counties, and most of the Southern California counties appear to have as many transit stops as the California counties situated around San Francisco Bay.  This pattern goes against conventional wisdom which says that Southern California is more car centric than the San Francisco Bay area.  What explains why the map shows a different pattern?  If the pattern should match conventional wisdom, what would you change in the plot?"
